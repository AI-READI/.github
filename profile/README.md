## Generating data and tools to boost future AI-driven research in diabetes 💉

* AI-READI is one of the data generation projects of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded Bridge2AI Program. 💰
* The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes. 💻💊
* The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health. 🧑🏽‍⚕️🧑🏽‍💼

## Tools and best practices to help future data generation project 🔧

We will develop and openly share tools, standards, and guidelines so that future data generation projects can follow our approach for sharing ethical, FAIR, and AI-ready datasets. You can follow the progress of our research by visiting the repositiories in our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AI-READI). 📂
