## Generating data, best practices, and tools to boost future AI-driven research in diabetes 

* AI-READI is one of the data generation projects of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded Bridge2AI Program.
* The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes.
* The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health.

## Tools and best practices to help future data generation project

We will develop and openly share tools, standards, and guidelines so that future data generation projects can follow our approach for sharing ethical, FAIR, and AI-ready datasets.
